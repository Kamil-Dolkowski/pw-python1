The file had too few picture expressions for btex...etex
blocks.  Such files are normally generated automatically
but this one got messed up.  You might want to insert a
picture expression now.

! An expression can't begin with `,'.

I'm afraid I need some sort of value in order to continue,
so I've tentatively inserted `0'. You may want to
delete this zero and insert something else;
see Chapter 27 of The METAFONTbook for an example.
